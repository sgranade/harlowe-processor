You come to see who’ll show up, what(link: &quot;…&quot;)[ well-meaning but dumb things they’ll say, that sort of thing.

This one’s in the late afternoon instead of the heat of the day, thank goodness. There aren’t any clouds between you and the sun, just red red rays that color everyone crimson.

It’s the usual graveside arrangement, with one of those green tents set up over the open grave and the casket on (link-reveal: &quot;a&quot;)[&amp;mdash;some kind of contraption that’ll drop it into the hole once the platitudes are done and no one’s looking any more. The funeral home workers scattered cheap plastic seats around the grave like birdseed. At least you got one of them. There’s not much fun about being old, but they do give you a seat when you damn well need one.

Being so close to the front, down with the [[mourners]], means you’re also close to the preacher who’s busy pretending he knew the deceased, talking over the sound of the [[tent fringe]] snapping in the wind.]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="after verses" tags="" position="388,808">It’s not a bad Bible passage, and the preacher didn’t launch into a bunch of hellfire and damnation talk. You’ve been to one funeral that went that way. It was like being strapped in a dentist’s chair, and the only thing that made it tolerable was that you weren’t paying for the experience.

Besides, the verses must’ve done their job because the [[man next to you]] is trying very hard not to tear up, though he’s not succeeding. He glances over and sees you staring, so you look down and fiddle with the [[funeral program]] they handed you.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="preacher" tags="" position="392,644">The preacher means well, which is kind of his job description when you get down to it.

He’s got on a dark and somber (link: &quot;smock&quot;)[//suit//, the kind that’s meant to show he’s there on God’s business.

He gestures with his worn, dog-eared Bible and flips it open one-handed. You wonder if he practices that move in front of a mirror. “I’d like to read from Paul’s first letter to the church in Corinth,” he says all serious-like.

“Behold, I shew you a mystery;
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:
for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

“For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

“So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, (link-reveal: &quot;Death is swallowed up in victory.&quot;)[

“O death, (link-reveal: &quot;where is thy sting?&quot;)[

The inside has the dead person’s name, Virginia, along with a terrible poem and “With Our Deepest Sympathy” above the name of the funeral home. Because nothing conveys real sympathy like a small fold of paper that was printed by the thousands.

It’s also full of those infuriating(link: &quot;…&quot;)[ euphemisms like “Entered Into Rest” instead of “Died” and “Interment” instead of “Burial”.

It’s one of your favorite hymns, too.

It’s been(link: &quot;…&quot;)[&amp;mdash;well, years since you sang in the choir at church, and you still miss it.

Then the graveside service is over. The man next to you stands up and rests his hand on the casket, gently, as if to convince himself that it’s there. “Love you, mom,” he whispers. The woman next to him leans on the casket, letting it keep her upright. The wind lifts her fine gold hair into a halo around her, and the sun’s red light catches her tears. Embarassed by the raw emotion, you put your hand on your four-legged cane and start to stand. The sandy-haired man takes your other arm, surprising you.

“C’mon, dad,” he says. “[[Let’s get you to the car-&gt;Title]].”]

Ever since that scare last year he’s been watching what he eats and being jealous watching what other people eat. You like the man, but he’s not going to get you to give up hashbrowns with cheese and onions. “I’ll be back, top off those coffees for you.”

As the waitress walks away, Will leans forward. “Okay, Dick, spill it. What’ve you been waiting to tell us?”

Dick grins. “Finished the kitchen yesterday.”

“About time,” you say. 

Gerald looks over at you. “Fred,” he says, with that tone of voice that means he wants everyone to try to get along. He takes things far more seriously than he should.

“No, of course I’m glad you’re done. You’ve been working on that remodel for(link-reveal: &quot;…&quot;)[well, I can’t even remember how long.” You smile, but you really can’t remember. There’s a [[blank spot-&gt;new appliances]] there.]</tw-passagedata>

“I bet,” Gerald says, setting down his coffee mug. “She regret asking you to do all that work? She can’t have liked not being able to use the kitchen for months.”

Dick considers. “I don’t think so. That kitchen was in bad need of updating &amp;mdash; had been for years. I’d been putting it off, but once I retired I left my excuses behind at the office.” Dick’s someone who loves working with his hands, and now that he has free time, he’s working through all of the projects he’d been talking about but not doing for years and years.

Dick’s mention of retirement reminds you that you’ve decided to retire as well. You start to tell the guys about your [[upcoming retirement-&gt;retirement]], but then you (link: &quot;hesitate&quot;)[(set: $hid_condition_count to it+1)(go-to: &quot;next project&quot;)].(set: $hid_condition_max to it+1)</tw-passagedata>

Will pretends to be shocked. “You? I figured you’d drop in the traces like the old nag you are.”

“It’s about time, Fred,” Gerald says. “If you get bored, you can join up with Dick and work on his house.”

“Thanks, no. I’ve got plenty to do my own self.” (display: &quot;warm coffee&quot;) “I’ve been down to three days a week for a while now, and I thought, well, why not go down to no days a week.” What you don’t say is that you’re far slower than you used to be, far less able to make the columns of numbers add up. Problems keeping track of dollars isn’t a trait people want in their accountant.

“You’ll love it,” Dick says, and he nods once. “Really love it.” And you will. Probably.

“You can join all us retired folks for coffee during the week,” Gerald says. [[You figure you will-&gt;next project]].

“Can’t decide between the guest bathroom or Michael’s old room.”

“Seems to me you’d save a lot of time just burning that house down and starting again,” Will says.

“Not really,” Dick replies.

“Besides,” you say, “you’d be a terrible arsonist. You’d take forever pouring the gas just so around the house to make it burn the way you’d want it to.” It’s the engineer in Dick. Some people measure twice and cut once. He thinks about the best way to measure, measures twice, re-thinks how he’s measuring, measures three more times, and only then does he maybe cut once.

There’s a lull in the conversation, the kind of hole that tends to get filled in with talk of [[sports]] or [[weather]].
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="sports" tags="" position="682,566">“So how ‘bout them Cowboys,” you say.

Will huffs. “You don’t care about Dallas. Don’t pretend you do.”

“It’s not my fault that Irvin got himself arrested,” you say. Will winces. The trial’s not over, but chances are the Cowboys won’t have the wide receiver for next year. “He’s going to leave a hole in your offence.

“You’re heartless, Fred,” Will says in the silence. “You’ve got no compassion.”

“Strippers!” you say, louder than you meant to.

“Fred!” Gerald says, looking around in case someone might faint at the sound of a man in his sixties saying “strippers”.

“We’re old, Gerald,” Dick says in that measured way he has when he’s advising someone. “We don’t have to care what other people think. Why fritter away our time on stuff that doesn’t matter?” He smiles then, pleased with what he’s about to say. “Like Dallas football.”

“Heartless. All y’all are heartless.”

“Fred has a heart,” Gerald says, “on his shelf back home.”

“It’s not on a shelf,” you say. “Virginia has it.”

Will chimes in, “Comes from being an [[Ole Miss grad]].”]]]

<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="weather" tags="" position="964,561">“So how ‘bout the weather,” you say.

“Hot. It’s always hot this time of year here,” Will says. He may get tired of the summer heat, but he’s a die-hard Texan. He jokes about Texas being like a whole ‘nother country, but you suspect he really believes that.

“You following the news about that plane that exploded?” Gerald asks. The accident’s been all over the news, but you don’t really remember the details or where the investigation’s gotten to. 

“Shot down,” Will says definitively.

“They’re saying that something exploded in it,” says Dick.

“Right. A missile. A terrorist missile exploded in it.”

“Who’d want to shoot down a plane?” you ask.

“Terrorists,” Will says. When he gets all certain like this, he can be a right pain. “It’s a terrorist thing. Probably linked to that bombing at the Olympics.”

Dick shakes his head and frowns. “I thought they had a suspect. That security guard.”

“Jewel!” you say, louder than you meant to. The name popped out of your mouth, like it had been floating around in your brain where you couldn’t feel it, waiting for some connection to hook it and drag it out of you.

Will clearly doesn’t agree. “Two big events like this, nearly back to back? [[It’s got to be a terrorist thing-&gt;terrorist thing]].”

You dump ketchup on your plate, fork up some of the hashbrowns, and dip them in the ketchup. The hashbrowns are piping hot and crispy around the edges, with onion bits frozen in a sea of melted American cheese. You used to be more careful about food, but these days why bother?

Tromping around Fort Jackson in time to the cadence was hot and miserable. But it was less demeaning than sitting on your ass, pretending to march so that doctor of yours won’t be mad at you.

“Let’s do some knee squeezes! Squeeze together; now relax! Squeeze together; now relax!” You do feel better when you do these exercises, but that doesn’t make you like them. The day program doesn’t cost money, but you pay for it with your dignity. “Don’t forget to squeeze your…you know…your ‘cheeks’ as well.” She makes little quote marks with her fingers. You sigh.

“You’re slacking on those knee squeezes,” Michael says.

“You want to show me how it’s done?”

“Fred!” the instructor calls out. “Keep going! Don’t get distracted!” She glares at Michael. He lifts his hands and makes his “sorry” face.

The instructor’s noticed your minor rebellion. “Nice, Harry!” she says pointedly. “Fred, look at Harry. See what great jumping jacks he’s doing?” Harry’s barely moving his arms. He’s in too much constant pain to be energetic thanks to that bad fall he took when he was a lineman for Ma Bell.

“You’re all doing so well!” the instructor says. She’s lying, of course. Some folks here can hardly move, age is weighing them down so heavily. “Your heart rate and your spirits should be up, up, up!”

You and Michael look at each other and bust out laughing, startling everyone around you. “Fred!” the instructor says. “You’re disturbing everyone!” You should stop. You know you should.

They pick up the silver platters that hold the bread and begin passing them around. When a platter reaches you, you take one square and hold it in your palm. The bread gleams white like a tooth. “This is my body, broken for you,” the pastor says. You chew the bread, which lodges itself between your teeth. Everyone spends a moment picking the bits of bread out with their tongue while trying not to be obvious about it.

The platter with the tiny cups is heavy, weighed down by the glass and liquid. It’s Welch’s grape juice, because everyone knows that alcohol’s bad for you and you certainly can’t admit drinking it. As Tom always says, the difference between Baptists and Methodists is that the Methodists will say hello to each other in the liquor store. “This is my blood, poured out for you.” The juice washes away the rest of the bread, replacing it with an acid tang.

One couple&amp;mdash;you think you were in Sunday School with them once&amp;mdash;are careful not to see you. That way they don’t have to talk to you.

There are a bunch of folks who act like you’re contagious, like sitting next to you or talking to you would leach their brains away, too. You mostly shrug and work hard not to let it bother you.

Virginia’s purse is on her usual pew(unless: $went_to_choir_room_first)[ in the sanctuary], tucked tight against the arm. It’s a white leather thing that’s more for decoration than for practicality.

When you straighten up after getting it, [[Pastor Mark]]‘s appeared beside you.

<tw-passagedata pid="117" name="nearly empty choir room" tags="" position="3484,1696">You meet Liz going out of the choir room as you’re coming in. She’s the soprano who’s had to suffer you singing the baritone parts at the back of her head all this time. “I’m going to miss you in choir, you old coot,” she says as she passes. “But next Sunday I’ll be sure to bring you that chocolate pecan pie I promised you.”

You don’t remember the promise or the conversation, but you’d be a fool to turn down one of Liz’s pies. “Sounds good,” you say to her retreating back. She waves without looking and is gone.

The choir room’s near to empty, so you sail through. Your hymnal and the sheet music from the morning’s anthem go on a table near the door and your three-ring binder goes in the bookcase where the folder lives. You always have to do this little juggling act at the rack where the robes go: you take off your robe, remove your sports coat from the hanger, put the robe and stole on the hangar, and shrug on your coat.

When you turn around after putting your coat back on, [[Pastor Mark]]‘s appeared beside you.
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="118" name="Pastor Mark" tags="" position="3344,1844">“Yancy told me you’re stepping down from choir as of today.” The pastor’s handshake is firm, his hands calloused from the work he does around the community. “Sorry you won’t be singing, but now I’ll get to see you during service.”

With a name like Samuel Mark and a hobby like wood-working, Pastor Mark must’ve been destined to be a preacher. He’s been at Second Baptist for going on a decade now. He replaced a man who, it turns out, didn’t take kindly to things the church did like ordain women deacons. He’d tried to split the church, but he ended up being the one to split. Sam’s been a calming influence and done wonders for the church’s work around the city and elsewhere.

“You want I should make faces at you? Keep you on your toes?”

Sam’s laughter is a deep rumble, the sound of distant thunder. “I think the congregation does that plenty without you [[piling on]].”
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="119" name="piling on" tags="" position="3344,1996">In the companionable pause that follows, you say, “I’d best get back to Virginia. We’re headed (if: (history:) contains &quot;up for lunch&quot;)[out for lunch with Tom and Rachel before we go home](else:)[home for lunch]. Don’t want to leave her waiting.”

Sam nods. “You do that.” You move towards the door, but stop when Sam says, “Fred?”

“Yeah?”

“All us ministers are here for you, but we’re not gonna press. Not our way. Know we’ll only do what you’re comfortable with us doing, and just remember that you can call on us any time. And tell Virginia too, will you?”

Your eyes are wet, and you blink rapidly. Your emotions won’t be leashed any more, but you’ll be dipped if you’re going to cry in front of the pastor.

Even now that you’re often confused and uncertain, you find that church calms you. It’s the routine; the years of attendance and ritual have worn grooves in your brain that your dementia hasn’t yet smoothed away.

You realize that you’re walking your old deacon’s beat, [[cleaning up discarded programs]] and [[straightening hymnals]] to help the staff prepare for tonight’s service.

There’s a blank space on one of the folds where you can take notes on the sermon. At least, that’s the theory. You’ve never used it for that, and you haven’t seen anyone else doing it, either. Too much like school, taking notes for a test that won’t be handed out until you die.

Pastor Mark would get on to you for that last thought. “Religion that’s too focused on heaven is no good here on Earth. Jesus didn’t call us to think happy thoughts about the next life. He called us to [[make life better here-&gt;the tidy sanctuary]].”

“Fred, you’ll never guess what I found.” She’s got a red file folder. You know from past experience that “FRED STRICKLAND” is written on its tab in Joan’s careful hand. One ragged corner of a torn-out newspaper article is peeking from between the folder’s covers.

“You know, Joan, it’d save time if you just came out and told me instead of us playing ‘Watch Fred fail to guess’.”

Joan’s unfazed by your remark. Once she’s got up a good head of steam, she doesn’t turn aside for anything. “I saw this article in the paper last week and thought of you.” She slides the newspaper clipping from the file folder and [[presses it into your hand-&gt;save the newspaper article]].

“It’s about the brain!” Of course it is.

“Great, I’ll read it&amp;mdash;”

“See, the brain is like a muscle. It has to keep lifting heavy things or it won’t stay strong.”

You think about lifting heavy things to drop on Joan. It’s not a charitable thought, but you don’t much care. Especially since you suspect that, even if you crushed her, she’d just slide more clippings to you out from under the rock.

“That’s fascinating. I’m [[sure the article&amp;mdash;-&gt;have a puzzle book too]]”

Hastily you scoop up your hymnal and music folder from the pew where you dropped them. “Gee, Joan, that’s thoughtful, but I’m carrying a lot of things already.”

“I know it looks heavy, but it isn’t! It’s big because it’s all big print, but the book uses very light paper to make it easier to carry.” She beams at you.

One of the things that it warned you was that friends might cope by trying to cure you. “It’s their way of trying to control the uncontrollable,” the brochure said. You don’t know that that’s why Joan keeps searching for cures, but the brochure’s prediction about how Joan would behave was spot on. Last month it was herbal supplements her friend swore would bring your memory back. You tried one of the ginkgo biloba tablets and then threw the rest away.

It’s infuriating that you have to spend energy being polite to people who should know better. You keep telling yourself that Joan means well, but there’s a yawning gulf between meaning well and [[doing well-&gt;saved by Tom]].

Joan’s frown is a weapon she’s happy to use to make you feel guilty. “I think you should take it now so you can start working the puzzles this afternoon. The sooner you start, the sooner your brain’ll be better.”

Tom sticks his head into the rapidly-emptying sanctuary and hollers, “Hey, get out here or we’ll [[pick the restaurant]] without you.” You’re saved.

“Looks like I’ve got to go,” you tell Joan and head to Tom quick as you can.

“Fred,” Virginia begins, but the doctor interrupts her. “No, jokes are good. I like to see patients keep their sense of humor.”

When you look up from your lunch of chicken-fried steak, Virginia’s watching you, waiting for your answer. “New stove?” you say.

Virginia sighs, though it’s a tiny sigh, so tiny you barely heard it over the sound of the other people eating lunch in the restaurant. “I’m thinking we should swap out the gas stove for a new electric one. Get one with a timer.”

“Our old one’s not broken, though.” You squint, trying to pull a memory free from the swamp of your mind. “Is it?”

Virginia shakes her head. “No, it’s not. But I thought&amp;mdash;”

“Don’t see the sense in spending money when we don’t need to,” you grumble.

“We do need to, though.” Virginia takes your hand and locks eyes with you. “You don’t have to shut the new stove off. [[It turns off automatically-&gt;babying you]].”

Don’t need to flush money away because you’re nervous.” 

Virginia takes back your hand and holds it tight. She glances around at the other tables in the restaurant, then says more quietly, “You’re right. I //am// nervous. But with reason.” Her thumb massages the back of your hand, tracing small circles over your skin. “We wouldn’t be wasting the money, and it’s not that expensive anyway.”

Virginia has that look on her face, the one that means that she’s going to do what she damn well pleases, and never mind what you want. “You said that the last two times, too.”

You don’t remember those earlier discussions. Stung, you snap, “Well, I’ll write it down so I won’t forget.” You pull your folded stack of index cards and a pen out of your back pocket. When you unfold the cards you’re brought up short. The top card reads, “[[IT&#39;S NOT YOUR FAULT]]“.]]

You nod, glad she reminded you what you’d been arguing about. “I really am sorry.”

“It’s already forgotten,” she says, with that tilt of her mouth that tells you she knows the joke she just made. It’s part of how you two deal with your condition, these sideways acknowledgements.

“The rolls?” Virginia asks. “I don’t think they’re any different than last time.”

“They are,” you say, shaking your head. A memory bubbles up, escaping the swamp. “When we came here last week I had the club sandwich and you got the enchiladas. The rolls were more flaky.”

“You’re thinking of the popovers from Dream CafÃ©. This is Poor Richard’s. We decided we didn’t want to drive all the way to Addison for lunch.”

You hold up a hand and she pauses while you pull your wallet out of your back pocket. But it’s not your wallet. It’s your stack of index cards. You pat your back pockets, but your wallet’s not there. 

To buy time to think, you fan out the index cards. “Miss, do you take plain paper?”

“Here,” Virginia says, handing the waitress a $20. “Keep the change.”

As the waitress walks away, you whisper to Virginia, “My wallet. I can’t find it.” You check under your napkin, then on the table before glancing at the floor. It better not be on the floor. You’re not getting down there and back up again without some serious help.

“You didn’t bring your wallet,” Virginia reminds you. “After the last time you lost it, we agreed that I’d bring the money when we went out.”

Your anger’s back. It’s the one thing that your mind reliably serves up, like a chef’s favorite dish that he can’t help but make. The cards are still in your hand. You run one finger along the edge of the topmost card, breathing deep. It’s not your fault. It’s not your fault. It’s not your fault.

“Thanks,” you say. (if: $refused_the_stove)[Your tone’s almost civil, hard as it is to be polite instead of mad.](else:)[You’re polite, even as you’re seething inside. That doctor warned you you’d be angry faster and sooner than you used to.]

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="203" name="the old colleague" tags="" position="8088,1288">It’s warm outside, though with a gusting breeze that makes you glad you brought your windbreaker. Now where did y’all park? You can’t see the car, but the thought reminds you to pull out your keys, which reminds you that you don’t have any keys, which reminds you not to worry about any of that because Virginia drives now.

“Where’s the car&amp;mdash;” you start to ask, but you’re interrupted by a black woman calling, “Ginny!” from the parking lot. She dodges around a slow-moving car that’s creeping past the front of the cafÃ©, waving one arm like she’s cleaning a window. “Ginny!”

Virginia adjusts her glasses. “Alma? Alma James, as I live and breathe! How you do?”

“Right fine, Ginny.” She’s no one you recognize, though that doesn’t mean much these days.

As if reading your mind, Virginia tells you, “Fred, this is Alma James. We used to teach English together.” She’s gotten real good at spoon-feeding you information like how you’d feed a baby bird.

“Still teaching it, in fact,” Alma says.

“Good for you! I miss teaching sometimes, but it was for the best that I retire.” She very deliberately doesn’t look over at you. “How’s Kevin?”

“Fair to middlin’,” she says.

“And your boys? What’s Cordell up to these days?”

“He majored in English down at Texas Tech.”

“Oh?” She tilts her head. You used to tease her that she looked (link-reveal: &quot;like&quot;)[ the RCA dog when she did that. “He was a right hellion in my class, you [[remember-&gt;more small talk]].”

The woman sighs, half exasperated, half amused. “Don’t I know it. But he righted his ship and ended up becoming a technical writer.”

“Well. As I live and breathe.”]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="204" name="more small talk" tags="" position="8088,1440">“What about his…brother?” Virginia says.

Alma nods. “Lamar. He’s at UT Austin. Going to graduate this year, God willing.”

Virginia laughs. “Must be interesting for you, having two sons at two different UT schools.”

“I couldn’t convince him to go to Arlington. He wanted to be a lot further away from home.”

You shift around a bit, leaning more heavily on your cane as you half-listen to Virginia and Alma. This kind of small talk never interested you much even when you were whole. There’s no place to sit out here, and it’s going to be murder on your feet if you keep standing for a while. You might could [[hint subtly-&gt;subtle hints]] that it’s time to go, or [[interrupt outright]].

<tw-passagedata pid="205" name="subtle hints" tags="" position="7940,1588">You look at your watch, and then over at Virginia. She doesn’t even notice, she’s so wrapped up in talking to that old colleague of hers. It’s her focus and care that made her such a good high school teacher. You couldn’t have taught like she did. A bunch of teenagers who you had to talk at for hours in the hopes that maybe one of them would listen and really learn something? No thank you.

One thing you miss about driving is that you don’t have keys to jangle in your pocket any more to let Virginia know it’s time to go. You do have some change in your pocket, so you rattle that around, just a bit at first, and then more and more. Finally you give a great big cough. It’s supposed to be a bit theatrical, but you put more into in than you meant to and it turns into a by-God real coughing fit.

“Fred!” Virginia says. “You okay?” She pats you on the back while your coughing slowly winds down. Lucky your lungs stayed where they’re meant to be. “Sorry, Alma, we’d best be getting home.” Her voice is full of regret.

“No problem,” (if: $refused_the_stove)[Alma](else:)[the woman] says. “So good you see you again, Ginny.”

“You, too,” Virginia says. “Fred, are you okay to wait here while I get the car?” When you nod, she takes off in one direction and the woman in another. “Nice to see you, Fred,” she says [[as she goes-&gt;waiting for Virginia]].</tw-passagedata>

“It’s okay. But my son’s the one at Austin.”

“Your son? I thought he was at Texas Tech.” That’s not right, though, and it shows on the woman’s face.

“My other son, Lamar, went to UT Arlington.”

“And you were studying English like Virginia taught?”

“I taught English //with// Virginia.” She’s got that expression on her face that you’ve come to dread: part puzzled, part sympathetic. She can tell that something’s wrong, that you’re not tracking the conversation perfectly, but she can’t be sure why. She won’t say anything, and she’ll do her best to work around your bad memory, like you let out an old-man fart she’s determined to ignore. The image makes you smile, which you know makes you look even odder and more out of touch. You’d say “sorry,” but you’re all out of sorry for right now.

Virginia says, “Alma, Fred and I’d betterâ€¦” She trails off.

“No problem,” the woman says. She looks like she feels bad for Virginia, or maybe you. Or maybe you’re imagining it. “It was real good to catch up with you, Ginny.”

“You, too,” Virginia says. “Fred, are you okay to wait here while I get the car?” When you nod, she takes off in one direction and the woman in another. “Nice to see you, Fred,” she says [[as she goes-&gt;waiting for Virginia]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="208" name="waiting for Virginia" tags="" position="8088,1752">You shift your weight some more, trying to get comfortable, or at least as near to it as you can while standing. Your mind drifts off. Left on its own it likes to float further and further away these days. It makes waiting a lot easier than it used to be when you were younger. Back then you always carried a book to pass the time in case you had to wait.

A touch on your shoulder brings you back to the here-and-now. A woman’s snuck up next to you. The waitress. Didn’t Virginia pay? Maybe she forgot, or you told her that you’d take care of it and then //you// forgot. That seems more likely. But you don’t have any cash on you. A while back you stopped carrying it when you’re eating out with Virginia.

“Hold on a moment, please, miss. My wife will be right back with the car.”

“Fred?” the waitress says. She sounds as confused as you feel.

“With the money. She’s got our cash. She can pay for our lunch.”

“Fred, it’s me. It’s Nipper.”

That was it! That was the RCA dog’s name. “Did you know, that’s my wife’s nickname! Gave it to her(link-reveal: &quot;…&quot;)[oh, ages ago.” Funny to think someone actually named their daughter “Nipper.” It takes all kinds.

“How about I take you to your wife,” the waitress says, pointing to a car idling in front of the restaurant. It’s an old powder-blue Buick, a lot like the one you used to drive back when you drove. The waitress tugs on your arm. “Let’s get you in the car.”

You’re not sure about this. Shouldn’t you [[wait for Virginia]] instead of [[going off with this stranger]]? Then again, more and more people are strangers to you lately.]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="209" name="wait for Virginia" tags="" position="8020,1892">“Thank you kindly, miss, but I’m waiting for my wife.”

“Let’s talk about it in the car.” She’s upset. She must really think you’d run off without paying. Though you guess that’s what you did.

Still and all, she’s being more pushy than she’s got call to be. “I said, I’m waiting for my wife, and that’s final.” You shake your arm free of the woman’s hand, but that sets you off-balance away from the waitress.
 
“Fred!” Virginia’s suddenly there on your other side, helping catch you as you stumble towards her.

“Virginia! Thank goodness you’re here. You can pay that waitress and tell her to leave me alone.” But you can’t see the waitress any more. “Oh! I guess she went back inside.” You right yourself and take your weight off of Virginia. She’s a slight thing. Can’t hold you up forever.

“It’s all fine, Fred.” She leads you to her Buick. You duck your head as you lower yourself into the passenger seat, then lift each leg with your hands to move them into the car. Virginia buckles your seatbelt and then goes around and gets in the driver’s seat.

But then she just sits there, staring out the windshield before slapping the steering wheel once with her hands, hard, and then again, and again and again. She bows her head and clutches that wheel so tight that her knuckles turn white. Her chest rises and falls as she takes several deep breaths. “It’s all good,” she whispers. “[[I’m fine.-&gt;angry Virginia]]”

<tw-passagedata pid="210" name="going off with this stranger" tags="" position="8156,1900">“You’ll take me to Virginia?” you ask the waitress. “You’ll have to help me in the car since my legs don’t quite work right.

“I’ll help.” And she does, making sure that you get in the passenger seat okay and buckling your seatbelt for you before she gets in the driver’s seat.

“Is she far? Virginia, I mean?”

“She’s close, Fred. It’s [all fine.”]&lt;all-fine|(click-append: ?all-fine)[

“I know.”

“Do you?” She faces you now. “Every day there’s less of you to take care of yourself, and more of you for me to take care of. There’s no break and no way out. We’re in a dark tunnel and the tunnel keeps getting narrower as we go through it. And I try not to dump this on you, I do, I swear I do, but there’s only so much bitterness I can swallow before I have to spit some of it back up.

“If you do know, here in a while you won’t any more. You’ll be gone, even if you’re still here.”

The silence fills the car, thick and oppressive, a fog of misery that both of you are lost in. You pull out your index cards again and riffle through them as if to blow that fog away. You peel the top one off the stack and wordlessly [[hand it to Virginia-&gt;IT&#39;S NOT YOUR FAULT redux]].

She holds the card in her lap and chews on her bottom lip like she does whenever she’s worrying at a problem. “That might be nice.”

“Call Leigh and the others. Been a coon’s age since you played bridge with them.”

The silence returns for a minute, though it’s less heavy than before. “I can do that,” she finally says. “Let’s get home and maybe take a nap.”

“Then put it in drive. It’s like I always say. If you’re not moving forward, you’re backing up.”

She laughs a short, sad laugh, hands you your card, and drops the car into gear. You put the card back on top of the others. The words “IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT” have run just a bit, now sprinkled with [[drops of water-&gt;lunch with Virginia end]].

“You’re not disturbing me at all. In fact, I’ve been speculating about how many days it would take before you talked to me.”

“Sorry, you were…”

“Waiting for you? No. Well, yes. A little.” She gestures to the Student Union. “I mean, I like studying here, what with the nice weather and how close I am to coffee.

“I’m Virginia Ward,” she says. “And you are…?”

You’re reluctant to draw this conversation out any more. You’ve got class soon, and she’s a bit unusual. But she stares up at you from the bench, eyes wide, patient but unmoving until finally, grudgingly, you say, “[[I’m Fred Strickland-&gt;not strangers]].”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="219" name="off-putting" tags="" position="9880,448">“Is it your normal habit to lie in wait for strangers on campus?”

“Virginia. Virginia Ward.”

“What?”

“I’m Virginia. And you areâ€¦?”

You jam your hands (if: $history contains &quot;don’t approach&quot;)[back ]in your pockets. You can wait out this woman.

Except it turns out that you can’t. She stares up at you from the bench, eyes wide, patient but unmoving. Finally, grudgingly, you say, “[[I’m Fred Strickland-&gt;not strangers]].”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="220" name="fourth for bridge" tags="" position="9880,1381.6666666666667">“You can be my fourth for bridge this afternoon,” Virginia tells you.

“Excuse me?” you say, thrown by the sudden change in topic.

“It’s a game involving cards. Perhaps you’ve heard of it?”

You snort. “I’ll allow as how I’ve heard of bridge. You want //me// to be //your// partner?”

She stands, letting her cigarette fall to the gravel. She stubs it out with the toe of her shoe. “Adeline and I normally partner against Dot and her beau Leland, but Addie’s focusing on her grades, poor thing, and isn’t up to scratch this month.”

You buy some time to think by taking another drag on your cigarette. Your lungs burn from the smoke curling inside of them, twisting around and around. “You act like this is Sadie Hawkins week.”

“Oh, good grief, Fred, it’s not like I’m asking you to pin me or anything. It’s a few hands of cards.”

Virginia’s intriguing and all, but you’re not sure how much time you’d want to spend around someone like her. Best to let her down gently, though. “Your Adeline may have the right idea. I have a lot of work to do for my current classes. Now may not be the best time.”

“Perhaps not, but now is what we’ve got,” she says.

That sparks a memory from your poetry class, and before you can stop yourself, you’re reciting:

“Forever &amp;mdash; is composed of Nows &amp;mdash;
‘Tis not a different time &amp;mdash;
Except for Infiniteness &amp;mdash;
And Latitude of Home &amp;mdash;

“From this &amp;mdash; experienced Here &amp;mdash;
Remove the Dates &amp;mdash; to These &amp;mdash;
Let Months dissolve in further Months &amp;mdash;
And Years &amp;mdash; exhale in Years &amp;mdash;

“Without Debate &amp;mdash; or Pause &amp;mdash;
Or Celebrated Days &amp;mdash;
No different Our Years would be
(link-goto: &quot;From Anno Dominies &amp;mdash;&quot;, &quot;now is what we have&quot;)“</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="221" name="now is what we have" tags="" position="9880,1513.3333333333335">Virginia tilts her head at you, looking like the dog on the RCA logo. The two of you stare, smoke rising between you from your cigarette. You’re barely aware of other students moving past the two of you, headed to class.

You break the silence. “I should&amp;mdash;”

“This afternoon. Let’s start with now and see what unfolds.”

Spend time with this woman who is so opinionated, so prickly? You open your mouth and are surprised to hear yourself say, “[[Well all right then-&gt;meeting Virginia end]].”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="222" name="not strangers" tags="" position="9880,596">“There, now we’re not strangers.”

“That’s&amp;mdash;that’s not how that works.”

“I believe that’s exactly how it works. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Fred Strickland.”

Good grief, this woman. “So it //is// your habit to lie in wait for strangers, and then try to turn them into not-strangers? You’ve got that much time to waste?”

“‘What is this life if, full of care, we have no time to [[stand and stare]]‘?”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="223" name="stand and stare" tags="" position="9880,768">“…that’s poetry, Mister Strickland.”

You stare back at her, this odd woman who was waiting for you to speak to her so that she could quote a line from a W. H. Davies poem at you. “Yes, I know.”

“I wasn’t sure, based on your expression, if you knew what poetry was.” When she smiles, she conjures dimples at the sides of her mouth.

“I’ve had plenty of it drummed into my head [[in my time-&gt;reading Keats]], thanks.”
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="224" name="reading Keats" tags="" position="9880,916">“I’m having the same thing done to me these days.” She holds up the book she’s carrying. “Keats.”

You pull out your pack of cigarettes. “You’re in Dr. Lane’s class?” You tap the pack sharply against your palm until one cigarette slides partway out. You pull it out and jam it between your lips.

“I am! He’s a fascinating teacher.”

“There you go, then.” You light your cigarette and take a deep drag from it. “I took his class last year. He’s in love with Keats.”

Virginia shrugs. “There’s no harm in that.”

You blow a cloud of smoke skywards, letting it spiral in the sky. Alan can blow smoke rings, but you’ve never mastered the trick of it. “I’m not as in love with poetry as you seem to be.”

Virginia leans forward, at once engaged and wary. “You don’t see value in poetry?”

“Oh, no, I think it’s all right.” You wave your cigarette in her general direction. “But quoting poetry at people? [[It seems a mite showy-&gt;poetry battle]].”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="225" name="poetry battle" tags="" position="9880,1068">“Showy?” Virginia leans back and pulls a cigarette pack of her own from her purse. “Only if you think of poetry as being more about performance instead of a way of expressing meaning.” She holds her cigarette out to you. You reluctantly light it.

She’s got spunk; you’ll give her that. “But declaiming bits of it at passers-by? Maybe I agree with Wordsworth. ‘The flower of sweetest smell is shy and lowly.’”

Virginia is on her feet in an instant, only five feet tall and yet radiating so much passion and intensity that it feels like sunlight on your face. She snaps, “Rest not! Life is sweeping by;
Go and dare before you die:
Something mighty and sublime
[[Leave behind to conquer time-&gt;hard work is worth it]]!”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="226" name="hard work is worth it" tags="" position="9880,1216">Virginia is breathing hard, her chest rising and falling. Surprised, you realize that you’re breathing hard, too. You run your hand through your hair, mussing it. Your mom always got onto you for that nervous habit. Getting a crew cut stopped you for a while, but the habit’s returned as your hair’s grown back out. “That’s a good one. Easy to understand, too. But a lot of other poetry is all about saying something without coming out and saying it. It’s too much work to understand.”

“Rewarding work,” Virginia says. She takes a deep drag on her cigarette, holds her breath, exhales. The white cloud of smoke spirals into the sky. “The best things in life [[take effort-&gt;fourth for bridge]].”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="227" name="take a call" tags="80% fadeIn" position="8872,96">“Fred?”

You freeze. You’d picked up the phone out of habit instead of letting Virgina get it, and now you’re stuck in a conversation with a voice you know you should recognize but don’t.

“Well, hey there!” You’re good at covering, buying enough time for your memory to catch up with you. “How’ve you been?”

“Fair to middlin’. Arthritis is acting up something fierce again, though.”

Arthritis. It’s likely someone who’s close to your age, then, and who’s willing to share [[these kinds of details-&gt;check the Rolodex]] with you.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="228" name="placement" tags="20% fadeIn" position="3836,144">Pamphlets on the table in front of you. Three of them. Pictures of empty, hollow rooms on them.

“This one looks nice.” The man touches one with his finger.

You nod and smile. Safest thing to do these days. “Is that your hotel?”

“No, dad, it could be your [[new home-&gt;angry about placement]].”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="229" name="driving with Tom" tags="60% fadeIn" position="8532,104">Tom drums softly on the passenger-side car dash. It’s just arrythmic enough to be annoying. The man never could sit still. “I don’t understand why Tuberville’s team is flaming out like it’s been doing,” he says.

“They’re passing too much,” you say, squinting through the windshield. You should reach the street to Waffle House soon. “Can’t get anything going on offense.”

“Bet you’re glad not to be there watching them lose all the time,” Tom says.

You shrug. “I’m an Ole Miss fan even when they’re terrible.”

“That’s good, I guess, because this year they’re really terrible,” Tom says. “By the way, you’ll want to [[take a left-&gt;I know where to go]] at the next cross-street.”</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="230" name="birthday party" tags="100% fadeIn" position="6544,128">You take a deep breath and blow at the two candles on your cake. The huge candle in the shape of a “6” goes out, but you don’t manage to put out the “0” candle.

“Ooh, so close,” Michael says.

Rebecca swats him on the arm. “He did just fine for someone of his advanced age.”

“You two,” Virginia says. She licks her fingers and pinches out the flame on top of the “0” candle.

“Be good or I’ll write you two out of my will,” you say. “Also, you won’t get any cake.”

“We’ll be good,” Michael says.

“//I’ll// be good, at least,” Rebecca chimes in.

“In that case, you each get a candle.” Virginia removes the two candles and passes one to each kid. Rebecca and Michael promptly suck the icing off of the [[bottom of the candles-&gt;a brief flash of forgetting]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="231" name="check the Rolodex" tags="" position="8872,244">“So what’re you calling about?” you ask. You cradle the phone between your ear and shoulder and use both hands to riffle through the old Rolodex on your desk.

“Didn’t know if you wanted me to pick you up for dinner tonight.”

Virginia walks into your home office and sees you going through the Rolodex cards at top speed. She motions to you to hold the phone up so she can hear as well. “Tonight?” you say. Who did you agree to have dinner with tonight?

“Since you’re on my way to the restaurant, I didn’t see much use in us driving separately.”

Virginia mouths the word “Will”. You nod, memory seeping back. You and Will were going to grab dinner and catch up, since he hadn’t been to your breakfasts with your cronies in a month.

Virginia gives you a brief hug. You smile at her before she wanders back out. She’s the better half of your brain. “Sure,” you tell Will. “[[That’d be great-&gt;take a call end]].”</tw-passagedata>

“It’s really okay,” you say. “We’ve got the party this weekend to have spouses and grandkids and friends and all of that hullabaloo.”

“I should keep your present until then,” the old woman across the table says, slicing into the cake and distributing the slices onto small paper plates.

“That’d be cruel and unusual punishment. You know he always wants his presents right away.” (link-reveal: &quot;It’s&quot;)[…who //is// that young man sitting next to Virginia?

“Birthday boy gets the first piece,” the old woman says, sliding a piece to you.

“Mo-om!” the young man sing-songs. “Why does he always get the first piece?”

“Yeah,” Virginia chimes in. “I should get the first piece.”

“No, me,” the young man says.

“No, me!”

You start to say something mean, but pull up short at the last second. He’s right, of course. Thankfully, since you made up with Tom, you’ve been better at catching your words before they escape you. “Sorry,” you say.

“No problem, Fred,” Tom says.

“You know, this reminds me of when we were on that sales call and I got us lost in the wilds of downtown Houston. I’ll never (link: &quot;forget&quot;)[get over how you looked when you realized I’d made us late for the pitch meeting.”

You glance over at Tom. He’s frowning. “What?” you say. You realize what’s wrong. “That was Dick who made you late, not me, wasn’t it?” You sigh. “That’s the problem with having a patchwork brain.

<tw-passagedata pid="270" name="Liz&#39;s reaction" tags="" position="2725,1640">You had lunch on Monday with Yancy, the music minister, and told him you were done. Then, that Wednesday after rehearsal, you told the whole choir about it, though you don’t remember any of the details.

You figured you needed to tell them since word was getting out. Some people were bound to get their back up if they didn’t hear about your condition from you. Besides, once you started telling folks, you assured them they could tell others as well. Keeping a secret like that in church is like carrying water in a colander. So you talked to the choir as a group.

[[But Liz you told direct]].</tw-passagedata>

From the tight set of her lips, it’s not okay. That’s fine. You don’t have to deal with her but for one hour more.

“I’ll see you in the [[break room-&gt;party in the break room]],” you say and pivot sharply on your cane and away from her desk.

}You stand, slowly, reaching for your cane and using it to lever you up. It’s something you used to hate, that cane, but now it’d be like hating your legs. Come to think of it, you //do// hate your legs, far more than you hate the cane. The cane doesn’t fold up unexpectedly on you.
