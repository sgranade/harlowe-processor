# harlowe-processor

A collection of Python scripts for reading the [Harlowe](https://twine2.neocities.org/) story format for [Twine](http://twinery.org/).

Twine is a tool for creating non-linear, interactive stories that are akin to the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books. Twine's story formats control how your story looks and provide macros to make programming your story easier. Harlowe is the (semi-)new story format that comes with Twine 2.0 and later.

The scripts in this repo parse a bare Harlowe file and build an in-memory representation of the story. It also provides sample scripts for dumping out all of the text in your story, building a room map, and more.
